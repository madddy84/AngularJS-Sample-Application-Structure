# AngularJS Sample Application Structure

Sample application structure for starting up with an AngularJS project which follows feature based approach

When working with a large scale application, then usual challenge we face is, how do we structure our code files in the application which is more redable, easy to maintain.

In conventional software development we have been seen most of the project are devided based on the Software architecture i.e. based on the layers in the application, or the type of object files. This works very well for a small or medium scale application, when all the files can easily seen in just a glance.

But then we are working with large application it is very dificult to navigate within between files as not all files are visible in one glance or atleast with liitle effort it can be found.


On the other hand if we could group the files based on feature (business feature) and not techinilogy or techinical architecture
